    Using jsoup-1.9.2.


    Program downloads  main images/videos from every single site, but not from "main library".

    If you use Safari Source:
        Using safari source, you may have to run it twice, due to the unsynchronized
        execution of program and Applescript. Applescript is written to get urls from 'window 1'
        which means it should be first window or exiting other Safari windows maybe be necessary.

    If you use Txt Source:
        You should ensure that txt file contains only 1 link per line.
        As written above, link shouldn't follow to "main library", but to every single site with desired file.
